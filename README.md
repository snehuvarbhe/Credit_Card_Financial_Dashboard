# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

## Project Overview
The "Credit Card Financial Dashboard" project aims to develop a comprehensive weekly report that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends in credit card operations. By leveraging Power BI, this project offers stakeholders the ability to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively, facilitating informed decision-making.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create two detailed dashboards:

1. **Credit Card Customer Report**: This dashboard provides insights into customer demographics, spending patterns, and credit card usage, helping to identify trends and opportunities for personalized marketing and customer engagement.
2. **Credit Card Transaction Report**: This dashboard focuses on transaction analysis, including transaction volumes, types, and potential fraud detection, enabling efficient monitoring of financial activities.

## Why Financial Dashboards?
Financial dashboards are crucial for:

- Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time.
- Identifying trends and patterns in customer behavior and transactions.
- Enhancing decision-making through data-driven insights.
- Improving operational efficiency and financial performance.

## Data Workflow
1. **Data Import**: A CSV file containing credit card transaction and customer data was imported into SQL to simulate a real-world scenario.
2. **Data Processing**: SQL was used for data cleaning and transformation to ensure data integrity and relevance.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Data from SQL was imported into Power BI, where interactive and insightful dashboards were created to visualize credit card customer and transaction data.

## Tech Stack
- Language: SQL
- Tools: Power BI, SQL

## Approach
